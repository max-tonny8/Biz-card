            <h1>What is a digital business card?</h1>
            <p>
              Digital business cards are the modern way to share contact
              information. Also known as virtual and electronic business cards,
              digital business cards are more interactive, cost-effective, and
              sustainable than their physical counterparts. One significant
              benefit of digital business cards is that they can be shared with
              anyone, anywhere. HiHello’s digital business cards can be created
              on iOS, Android, or computer and can be completely customized to
              fit your style.
